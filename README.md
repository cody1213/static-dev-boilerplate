Node Quick Dev Boilerplate 
============
A node.js-based dev server and starter boilerplate for fast development of client projects. Compiles from SCSS, Pug, and Babel and makes a neat little dist/ folder to upload to a server.

###Installation###

1. Install node packages and bower components

		npm install

2. Start the web server

        npm start

3. Visit [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in your browser

And that's it.  Edit anything in the src/ folder and it will be reflected in the dist/ folder.  Make sure to add assets (like images) to the dist folder (dist/assets/images) folder.
